# Notes Week 4


## Excel and R

I've used excel at a few of my job placements now so I am decently familiar with it. At my first placement, I became friends with someone who absolutely loved to play around in excel so when things were slow she would show me some tips and tricks to get more use out of it. This came in handy when we were trying to document our pay to ensure that the Phoenix Pay System hadn't messed things up. 

At my current placement, I've done some data analysis using Excel, as well as other textual analysis software so I do have some prior knowledge. This made things go smoothly for me and I enjoy using Excel for the most part.




R also worked well for me, when I remembered to run commands from the beginning of the line that is. Occaisonally I would forget and that would led to things not working for me which was frustrating but as I went back and re-ran things everything worked out well. 

I didn't explore extra things with this, even though it would have been interesting to do so.


## Voyant


I've used voyant quite often, I think I started with the basics in highschool but I have used it in multiple classes in University. I had a fairly deep dive in my DIGH 3001A class last year to explore Othello. This familarized me with it so I knew how to work the various tools already and how to play around with it to find interesting results. 

##### Making my own corpus

I was able to use some of the skills learned in previous weeks to assemble a brief corpus to use with Voyant.


## AntConc

I played a round a little in AntConc and it seemed to be a very robust tool to help do some textual analysis.



## Topic Modelling

Mallet was a pain. At first I didn't realize I had to install it to my C:/ drive so i had it elsewhere and had set the environment path correctly but it still didn't work. 

Googled "mallet requires an environment variable mallet_home" to figure it out and came accross [this handy guide](https://electricarchaeology.ca/2011/08/30/getting-started-with-mallet-and-topic-modeling/) this handy guide to installing it that showed me the error of my ways, and that it had to be installed in C:/.

After that everything worked well with the Topic Modelling tool. Somehow my export folder defaulted back to my C:/User/Willi folder but I changed it back and moved the folders over.



Topic Modelling in R worked fine. I ran into a few instances where commands weouldnt run because I needed to install a new library. So I just installed the required library and then used it and it worked fine. I did have one variable that wouldnt work but I realized it was because i accidentally skipped the line where i defined it so I went back and ran the command again and then everything worked. Now that I have this script I believe I could definitely alter it to fit different data.
